# Eva

Eva is a Scheme interpreter written in C.

## Build

Just run `make`.

## Usage

There are three ways to use the program `bin/eva`:

- `eva`: Start a new REPL session.
- `eva -e expression`: Evaluate expressions and print their results.
- `eva file1 file2 ...`: Execute one or more Scheme files.

In addition, you can pass the `-n` or `--no-prelude` flag to disable automatic loading of the [prelude](src/prelude.scm).

## Language

All Schemes are different. The Eva dialect is fairly minimal. It supports some cool things, like first-class macros, but it lacks other things I didn't feel like implementing, such as floating-point numbers and tail-call optimization.

### Data types

Eva has 9 types:

1. **Null**. There is only one null value, written `()`. Unlike in most Schemes, `()` is self-evaluating and does not need to be quoted.
2. **Symbol**. Symbols are implemented as interned strings. The quoted expression `'foo` evaluates to the symbol `foo`. (Another round of evaluation would look up a variable called "foo.")
3. **Number**. Numbers in Eva are signed integers. Their width is whatever Clang decides `long` is on your machine.
4. **Boolean**. There are two boolean constants: `#t` and `#f`. Everything in Eva is truthy (considered true in a boolean context) except for `#f`. 
5. **Character**. These are just single-byte ASCII characters. They are written like `#\A`, and then there are the special character `#\space`, `#\newline`, `#\return`, and `#\tab`.
6. **String**. A string of characters. Unlike symbols, these are not interned, and they are mutable. They are written with double quotes, like `"Hello, World!"`.
7. **Pair**. You can't have Lisp without pairs. These are your standard cons cells. For example, `(cons 1 2)` evaluates to the pair `(1 . 2)`.
8. **Procedure**. Procedures are created by lambda abstractions. A procedure `f` can be called like `(f a b c)`.
9. **Macro**. Macros are just procedures that follow different evaluation rules. They allow the syntax of Eva to be extended.

### R5RS conformity

Eva implements the following standard procedures from [R5RS][1]:

```
eq? eqv? equal?
number? integer?
+ - * / quotient remainder modulo
= < > <= >=
zero? positive? negative? even? odd?
min max abs gcd lcm expt
number->string string->number
boolean? not
pair? cons car cdr set-car! set-cdr!
caar cadr cdar cddr
null? list? list length append reverse
list-tail list-ref
memq memv member assq assv assoc
symbol? symbol->string string->symbol
char? char=? char<? char>? char<=? char>=?
char-alphabetic? char-numeric? char-whitespace?
char-lower-case? char-upper-case?
char->integer integer->char
char-upcase char-downcase
string? make-string string-length string-ref string-set!
string=? string<? string>? string<=? string>=?
substring string-append string->list list->string
string-copy string-fill!
procedure? eval apply map delay force
read write load
```
